WHAT: 
This is a Chrome browser extension that replaces the word "mask" with the word "pants," to help make pandemic anti-mask arguments make even less sense.

WHY:
For fun.

HOW:
To install this extension in your Chrome browser, follow these steps:

1. Download this git repository to your computer by clicking "Code" and then "Download ZIP." 
2. Unzip/extract the ZIP on your computer.
3. Go to this URL in your Chrome browser: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click to check the box for "Developer mode."
5. One of the new buttons that should appear is "Load unpacked extension." Click it. 
6. Choose the folder that the unzipped/extracted files are in (probably called "covid-mask-pants-plugin-master").
7. The extension should now appear and the "Enabled" box should be checked. Start browsing pandemic skeptic forums to learn about the reasons people don't think they should have to wear pants in public.

EXAMPLE:
Here is a screenshot of a google news headline, with this plugin enabled. (Text: "Mayor 'disgusted' as crowds in downtown Savannah disregard pants mandate")
